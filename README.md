    "Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will
    not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius
    will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not;
    the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination
    are omnipotent." - Calvin Coolidge
```
