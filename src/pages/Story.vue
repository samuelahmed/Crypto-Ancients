  <q-card-section class="q-pt-none">
  A non-fungible token (NFT) is a token in a series in which each member is different. Humans are non-fungible members of the homo sapiens series, whereas the US dollar bills are fungible because they can be exchanged equally for one another. The homo sapien series is backed by methods of biology (decentralized) while the US dollar is backed by the government (centralized).

  It depends on your definitions and which blockchain your NFT is on. In most cases the image itself is stored with an IPFS (which is semi-decentralized) and not on the blockchain. The NFT is a smart contract that is stored on a blockchain; some blockchains are more decentralized than others.

  They do not. Crypto ancients consists of a few hundred layers made in photoshop, had a JS program rearrange into 10,000 unique Ancients, uploaded to pinata IPFS, pointed a Ethereum smart contract to those images, built a website, and made that contract available for minting. In most cases that is every NFT project today, give or take some bells and whistles.

  Not at all! NFTs are creating the foundations for digital ownership. While Ethereum and other L1 blockchains created the methods. The actual pathway to ownership is defined by constant conflict among all the members and eventual agreement as to what ‘owning’ means.
