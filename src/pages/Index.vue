        Blockchains are a method to validate the exchanges on a distributed ledger. Each block is tied to a specific value that is created by running the data within through a cryptographic hash. Any change to the block will change that value wildly, so just by knowing that number we can be certain that past data has not been altered. Solving other cryptographic puzzles we can decide which miner can post a block and be rewarded. In other words we are building a structure of data with properties that improve upon human trust.

        Ledgers are one of the foundations of capitalism. They allow for enterprise at scale, borrowing and loaning, the standardization of money exchanges and the ability to do so quickly securely without having to carry lots of valuable goods, such as precious metals or cash. For ledgers to work they need to be backed by some sort of authority so that the users know they can rely on what is writen. The beauty of decentralized cryptographic ledgers is that they allow all parties to rely on crytographic proofs instead of human-institutiosn to create trust.

Somewhere between 5-10% of the world’s economy is given to banks. In exchange they allow commerce at scale; international money exchanges, acts as a trusted third party, loans, basic financial services, and more. Without the internet this price tag is a bargain. However, in today’s world it is about 3-10% too high. More so, decades of clear disregard for structural stability, basic economic security, high fees to users, and constant predatory practices make a strong case for investments in alternatives.

Bitcoin (2009) by Hal Finney is the genesis blockchain which combines many advances in digital cryptography to create the first stable peer to peer digital currency.  It is akin to creating a new element, the socioeconomic impacts of blockchains will be transformative. Bitcoin is a naturally deflationary asset.  Like natural elements, Bitcoin is restricted in shape and form, making it stable and secure yet not very malleable. In contrast Ethereum (2013) by Vitalik Buterin is a virtual state machine blockchain. Turing complete and able to host applications and smart contracts and decentralized applications. The future of blockchain will be build upon these two empires: The bitcoin empire of deflation in which all economies are pegged relative to, and the ethereum empire of web3 which allows for digital ownership by individuals.

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a series in which each member is different. Humans are non-fungible members of the homo sapiens series, whereas the US dollar bills are fungible because can be exchanged equally for one another. The homo sapient or felis catus series are backed by methods of biology (decentralized), the US dollar is backed by the government (centralized). NFTs are digital tokens backed by new decentralized authorities known as blockchains.
