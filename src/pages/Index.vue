Simply put a blockchain is a distributed digital ledger, a record of IDs and their assets that is maintained by many full-nodes globally. The revolution ushered by Bitcoin is the ability to turn computing power into social trust. So that all participants in the network can be assured that the ledger is most likely accurate even in the face of adversaries.

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a series in which each member is different. Humans are non-fungible members of the homo sapiens series, whereas the US dollar bills are fungible because can be exchanged equally for one another. The homo sapient or felis catus series are backed by methods of biology (decentralized), the US dollar is backed by the government (centralized). NFTs are digital tokens backed by new decentralized authorities known as blockchains.
